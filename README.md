## Live Demo

Check out the live project on Netlify: https://cozy-taiyaki-2cb90b.netlify.app/

Please note that there might be issues with loading products from server on the live demo.


## Description

 The application is designed with user-friendly features and a responsive layout.

## main features

- Private Authentication: Every user must authenticate themselves before using the store, ensuring data security and confidentiality.
- Product Catalog: We offer a product catalog that can be easily browsed by users. You can search for products in different categories and filter them by price, as well as search by name.
- Product Creation: Users have the option to create new products and add them to the catalog. This helps keep the product range constantly updated.
- Add to Cart: Users can add selected products to their cart for convenient order placement.
- Order Placement: When the cart is filled, users can place an order, specifying delivery and other necessary details.
- Product Filtering: The product catalog supports the ability to filter by price, sorting them in ascending or descending order. This allows users to quickly find products that meet their requirements.
- Product Search: The store also features a search function that allows users to find specific products by name.

Our application is designed with user convenience and the needs of a modern online store in mind. It is a convenient and efficient tool for shopping and managing products.

## Backend

The application uses a fake REST API provided by [json-server]([https://github.com/typicode/json-server](https://privateauth.onrender.com)) 

## Frontend
- The latest version of React is used.
- Functional components and JSX are employed.
- Icons from the [lucide-react](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) library are used.
- React Forms: I leveraged React to create and manage forms within the application. This allows for a dynamic and responsive user experience when capturing and submitting data.
- Material-UI for Input Elements: I incorporated Material-UI components for input fields to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the form.

## UI Requirements

The application follows an eye-friendly design and is responsive.
